If you want to play PC games that support Xbox 360 controllers, but you only have a different type of controller, you may need to use an emulator software that can make your controller function as an Xbox 360 controller. One of the most popular emulator software is Xbox360emu 3.0.zip, which is a compressed file that contains the x360ce application and libraries.

In this article, we will show you how to download, install and configure Xbox360emu 3.0.zip to play your favorite PC games with any controller.
 
## Step 1: Download Xbox360emu 3.0.zip
 
You can download Xbox360emu 3.0.zip from various online sources, such as [2shared](https://www.2shared.com/file/sNwf2Syn/xbox360emu_30.html) [^2^]. However, be careful when downloading files from unknown sources, as they may contain viruses or malware. Always scan the files with an antivirus software before opening them.
 
## Step 2: Extract Xbox360emu 3.0.zip
 
After downloading Xbox360emu 3.0.zip, you need to extract it to a folder on your PC. You can use any file compression software, such as WinRAR or 7-Zip, to do this. Right-click on the zip file and choose "Extract here" or "Extract to xbox360emu 3.0" depending on your software.
 
## Step 3: Install x360ce application and libraries
 
Once you have extracted the zip file, you will see two folders: x360ce.App and x360ce.Libraries. The x360ce.App folder contains the x360ce.exe file, which is the main application that will emulate your controller. The x360ce.Libraries folder contains various dll files that are required for the emulation to work.
 
To install the x360ce application and libraries, you need to copy them to the same folder where your game executable is located. For example, if you want to play Grand Theft Auto V with your controller, you need to copy the x360ce.exe file and the dll files from the x360ce.Libraries folder to the GTA V folder (usually C:\Program Files\Rockstar Games\Grand Theft Auto V).
 
## Step 4: Run x360ce.exe and configure your controller
 
After copying the files to your game folder, you need to run the x360ce.exe file as administrator. You will see a window that will ask you to create a configuration file (xinput1\_3.dll) for your game. Click on "Create" and wait for the application to detect your controller.
 
If your controller is not detected automatically, you may need to click on "Add" and select it manually from the list of devices. You can also click on "Auto" to let the application search for compatible controllers on your PC.
 
Once your controller is detected, you will see a window that shows how your controller buttons are mapped to the Xbox 360 controller buttons. You can change the mapping by clicking on each button and choosing a different one from the drop-down menu. You can also adjust the sensitivity and deadzone of your analog sticks and triggers by moving the sliders.
 
When you are satisfied with your configuration, click on "Save" and close the x360ce.exe window. You can now run your game and enjoy playing it with your controller.
 
## Troubleshooting
 
If you encounter any problems while using Xbox360emu 3.0.zip, here are some possible solutions:
 
- If your game does not recognize your controller or shows incorrect button prompts, you may need to use a different dll file for your game. You can try renaming xinput1\_3.dll to xinput9\_1\_0.dll or xinput1\_4.dll and see if that works.
- If your game crashes or freezes when using Xbox360emu 3.0.zip, you may need to disable any anti-virus or anti-malware software that may interfere with the emulation process. You can also 0f148eb4a0
