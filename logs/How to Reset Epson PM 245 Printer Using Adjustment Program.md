Some tips to keep your Epson PM 245 printer in good condition are:

- Use genuine Epson ink cartridges and photo paper. They are designed to work best with your printer and produce high-quality prints.
- Clean the print head regularly using the adjustment program or the printer's control panel. This can prevent clogging and improve the print quality.
- Replace the waste ink pad or install an external waste ink tank when the printer reaches its service limit. The adjustment program can help you to reset the counter, but you still need to replace or empty the pad to avoid ink leakage.
- Store the printer in a cool and dry place. Avoid exposing it to direct sunlight, dust, or moisture.

Epson PM 245 is a great photo printer that can give you beautiful prints in minutes. However, if you encounter any problems with your printer, you can use an adjustment program to fix them easily. You can also contact Epson support for further assistance.
